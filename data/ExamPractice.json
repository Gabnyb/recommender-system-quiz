    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "Content-based Filtering (CBF) is a popular recommendation approach that primarily focuses on using the content features of items, such as genre or keywords, to suggest items with content features similar to those items previously liked by a user. For instance, in the book recommendation domain, a CBF might analyze the words within books to find content-based similarities and generate recommendations of books for users."

    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "• Approach 1 \"Show me more of the same that I've liked\": Content-based Filtering (recommends similar items based on content features)<br>• Approach 2 \"Show me what fits based on my needs\": Knowledge-based (uses explicit user requirements)<br>• Approach 3 \"Show me what's popular among my peers\": Collaborative Filtering (uses peer behavior/ratings)"

    "Question": "Why using Term Frequency (TF) alone is not a good approach for modeling documents?",
    "Options": {
      "A": "It assumes all terms have similar importance",

      "C": "It ignores the uniqueness of terms in different documents",

    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "All of the given options. TF alone: (1) assumes all terms have similar importance, (2) doesn't consider document length, and (3) ignores term uniqueness across documents. This is why TF-IDF is typically used instead."

      "A": "Precision measures the proportion of retrieved instances that are relevant. Recall measures the proportion of relevant instances that are retrieved.",

    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "Precision measures the proportion of retrieved instances that are relevant. Recall measures the proportion of relevant instances that are retrieved. For example, in a movie recommender, precision measures the proportion of recommended movies that are relevant (actually good). Recall measures the proportion of all good movies that are recommended."
