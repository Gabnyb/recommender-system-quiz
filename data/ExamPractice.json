    "Answer": "Approach 1: CBF, Approach 2: Knowledge-based, Approach 3: CF",
    "Explanation": "• Approach 1 \"Show me more of the same that I've liked\": Content-based Filtering (recommends similar items based on content features)<br>• Approach 2 \"Show me what fits based on my needs\": Knowledge-based (uses explicit user requirements)<br>• Approach 3 \"Show me what's popular among my peers\": Collaborative Filtering (uses peer behavior/ratings)"

    "Question": "Why using Term Frequency (TF) alone is not a good approach for modeling documents?",
    "Options": [
      "It assumes all terms have similar importance",
      "It doesn't consider the length of the document",
      "It ignores the uniqueness of terms in different documents",
      "All of the given options"
    ],
    "Answer": "All of the given options",
    "Explanation": "All of the given options. TF alone: (1) assumes all terms have similar importance, (2) doesn't consider document length, and (3) ignores term uniqueness across documents. This is why TF-IDF is typically used instead."

    "Question": "What do Precision and Recall measure?",
    "Options": [
      "Precision measures the proportion of retrieved instances that are relevant. Recall measures the proportion of relevant instances that are retrieved.",
      "Precision measures the total number of predictions. Recall measures the accuracy of predictions.",
      "Precision measures the speed of the algorithm. Recall measures memory usage.",
      "Precision measures user satisfaction. Recall measures system performance."

    "Answer": "Precision measures the proportion of retrieved instances that are relevant. Recall measures the proportion of relevant instances that are retrieved.",
    "Explanation": "Precision measures the proportion of retrieved instances that are relevant. Recall measures the proportion of relevant instances that are retrieved. For example, in a movie recommender, precision measures the proportion of recommended movies that are relevant (actually good). Recall measures the proportion of all good movies that are recommended."
