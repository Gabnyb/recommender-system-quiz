    "Options": {
      "A": "Item X — higher variance means more uncertainty",
      "B": "Item Y — higher average predicted rating",
      "C": "Item X — lower prediction variance",
      "D": "Item Y — lower variance is better"
    },
    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "<b>Item X</b> should be selected because it has <b>higher prediction variance</b> (0.11 vs 0.005).<br><br>Higher variance indicates disagreement among neighbors, meaning the rating is uncertain. Getting the actual rating for uncertain items provides more information to improve the model."
